# Studio Color Book

**Studio Color Book** is a creative project aimed at developing a series of coloring books featuring charming boxer dogs in formal wear, set in various intellectual and creative environments. The project combines artistry and storytelling, with a focus on elegant character portraits that capture the personality and style of each dog character.

## Project Overview

This repository contains the concepts, prompts, and AI-generated line art for the Studio Color Book. Each edition of the coloring book will feature a different theme, exploring the intellectual and creative worlds through the lens of our boxer dog characters. The initial editions being developed are:

- **Modern Intellectuals Edition**: Featuring boxer dogs as tech innovators, environmental scientists, and more, set in contemporary intellectual settings.
- **Creative Edition**: Showcasing boxer dogs as artists and writers, immersed in creative pursuits.
