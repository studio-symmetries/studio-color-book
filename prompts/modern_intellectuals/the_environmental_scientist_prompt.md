# Prompt: The Environmental Scientist

A white boxer dog with a brindle spot around one eye, wearing an outdoor jacket and cargo pants, kneels in a lush green field. The dog holds a magnifying glass to examine a plant closely while jotting down notes in a field journal. Around the dog are flowers, tall grass, and a small river flowing nearby. An open portable lab kit is beside the dog, containing scientific tools. Draw this scene in a painterly style with detailed line art for a coloring book, highlighting the dog's focus on research and the peaceful natural environment.
