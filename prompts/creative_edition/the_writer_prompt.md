# Prompt: The Writer

A white boxer dog with a brindle spot around one eye, wearing a casual sweater and reading glasses, sits at a wooden desk with a vintage typewriter. The dogâ€™s expression is thoughtful, and it is typing out a manuscript, with one paw on a stack of papers. The study is cozy, featuring a bookshelf filled with books, a framed picture on the wall, a potted plant, and a coffee cup on the desk. A candle provides a soft, warm glow to the room. Draw this scene in a painterly style with detailed line art for a coloring book, highlighting the dog's concentration and the cozy, creative atmosphere.
