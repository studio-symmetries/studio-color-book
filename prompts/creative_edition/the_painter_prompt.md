# Prompt: The Painter

A fawn boxer dog with a gentle, focused expression stands in front of a large canvas on an easel, painting with a brush in one paw and a palette in the other. The dog is wearing an artist's smock splattered with different colors of paint. The studio is filled with canvases, paint tubes, and brushes. Sunlight streams in through a window, casting a warm glow over the scene. A stool with a spilled paint jar adds to the creative atmosphere. Draw this scene in a painterly style with detailed line art for a coloring book, capturing the dog's artistic passion and the vibrant studio environment.
