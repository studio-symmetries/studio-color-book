## Concept "Quests"

To track the progress of each concept, refer to our [Concept Quests](./concepts/CONCEPT_QUESTS.md). This checklist provides an engaging and interactive way to see which concepts have been developed, which prompts have been written, and which line art has been completed.

# Concepts Directory

This directory contains detailed descriptions of the themes, settings, and characters for each edition of the Studio Color Book. The concepts serve as the foundation for creating prompts and generating line art.


## Directory Structure

- **modern_intellectuals/**: Contains concepts related to the Modern Intellectuals Edition, focusing on contemporary professions and intellectual pursuits.
- **creative_edition/**: Contains concepts for the Creative Edition, highlighting artistic and creative boxer dog characters.

## How to Contribute

1. **Review Existing Concepts**: Start by reading through the existing concept files to understand the themes and settings.
2. **Submit New Concepts**: If you have ideas for new characters or themes, create a markdown file with your concept details and submit it through a pull request.
3. **Provide Feedback**: Offer feedback or suggestions to improve the existing concepts by commenting directly on the concept files.

Each concept should include a clear description of the dog character, their attire, setting, pose, and any relevant accessories. Aim to capture the personality and unique traits of the character.
