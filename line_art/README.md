# Line Art Directory

This directory contains AI-generated line art based on the prompts from the `/prompts` directory. The line art is categorized by edition and concept, allowing for easy management and updates.

## Directory Structure

- **modern_intellectuals/**: Line art for the Modern Intellectuals Edition, organized by specific concepts.
- **creative_edition/**: Line art for the Creative Edition, organized by specific concepts.
- **original/**: Raw AI-generated images before any manual edits.
- **edited/**: Line art that has been manually refined and edited for clarity and style.
- **final/**: Finalized line art ready for inclusion in the coloring book.

## Guidelines for Managing Line Art

1. **Review Original Art**: Check the `original` subdirectories for raw AI-generated images.
2. **Edit and Refine**: Use graphic design tools to refine the line art. Save edited versions in the `edited` subdirectories.
3. **Finalize Art**: Once reviewed and approved, move the completed line art to the `final` subdirectories.
4. **Feedback and Iteration**: If changes are needed, edit the line art files and repeat the process until the desired quality is achieved.
