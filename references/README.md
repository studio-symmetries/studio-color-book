# References Directory

This directory contains reference images and other materials used for inspiration in developing concepts, prompts, and line art for the Studio Color Book.

## Directory Structure

- **images/**: Contains reference images for character designs, clothing, settings, and other visual elements.
- **inspiration/**: A collection of artwork, sketches, and other creative materials that inspire the themes and concepts.

## How to Use References

1. **Gather Inspiration**: Use the images and inspiration materials to inform character designs and settings.
2. **Add New References**: If you have additional reference images or materials that align with the projectâ€™s themes, add them to the relevant subdirectory.
3. **Documentation**: Include a brief description of each reference, explaining how it relates to the project or which aspect it inspired.

References should be organized and labeled clearly to make them easily accessible for concept development and prompt writing.
