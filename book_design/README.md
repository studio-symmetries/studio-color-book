# Book Design Directory

This directory contains resources related to the design and layout of the Studio Color Book. The files here will be used to compile the final version of the coloring book for digital and print formats.

## Directory Structure

- **digital_layout/**: Layout files and templates for creating a digital version of the coloring book.
- **print_layout/**: Layout files and templates for creating a print-ready version of the coloring book.
- **cover_design/**: Designs and artwork for the book cover, including title, author name, and any back cover elements.

## How to Use Book Design Files

1. **Digital Layout**: Use the templates in the `digital_layout` folder to create an e-book version of the coloring book. Ensure that all pages are formatted correctly for digital reading.
2. **Print Layout**: Use the `print_layout` files to prepare the book for print. Pay attention to bleed, margins, and other print specifications.
3. **Cover Design**: Develop and refine the book cover using the `cover_design` folder. The cover should be visually appealing and reflect the themes of the book.

Collaborators can contribute by suggesting layout improvements, helping with design elements, or providing feedback on the overall look of the book.
